Why use a method for gamemode?
I decided to use a method because its really simple and its easier for people to look at my code and give me feedback. (I am aware that the method is slower)

What's the purpose of this project?
The purpose is to create a simple, fast and low memory usage core plugin that is 100% message configurable.
